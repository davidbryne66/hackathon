PHASE 5: CONVERSATIONAL ANALYTICS INTERFACE
===========================================

Prerequisites:
- Phase 4 complete (LookML model deployed to Looker)
- Gemini API key
- Looker API credentials

INCREMENTAL PROMPTS
-------------------

1. Initial Setup
   "Read info.txt and understand Phase 5: Conversational Analytics Interface. 
    Build a Python application with Streamlit that allows users to ask questions in plain English.
    The app should:
    - Use Gemini AI to translate natural language to Looker queries
    - Execute queries via Looker API
    - Display results with visualizations
    - Maintain conversation history
    
    Create the following files:
    - app.py (main Streamlit app)
    - gemini_client.py (Gemini API integration)
    - looker_client.py (Looker API integration)
    - requirements.txt
    - .env.example
    - README.md"

2. LookML Context Integration
   "The Gemini client needs complete LookML field catalog for all 5 explores:
    - sales_analysis
    - product_reviews
    - inventory_analysis
    - purchasing_analysis
    - manufacturing_analysis
    
    For each explore, include:
    - Dimensions (grouping fields)
    - Measures (metrics)
    - Field descriptions
    - Use cases
    
    Add concrete examples showing NL question → JSON query structure.
    Ensure dimensions and measures are always included in generated queries."

3. UI Refinements
   "Refine the Streamlit interface:
    - Fix white box display issues in chat messages (transparent backgrounds)
    - Remove excessive emojis for professional appearance
    - Improve metric formatting (K/M suffixes for large numbers)
    - Add smart chart selection (bar for ≤10 rows, line for >10)
    - Display statistical summaries (min, max, avg)
    - Add response time tracking"

4. Multi-Conversation Support
   "Add conversation management features:
    - Multiple chat threads with independent history
    - Switch between conversations
    - Delete conversations
    - Track per-conversation statistics (query count, avg response time)
    - Show active conversation indicator"

5. Advanced Features
   "Add enterprise features:
    - Settings toggle to enable/disable AI insights and query details
    - Professional export reports (markdown with session metadata)
    - In-app help system with examples and data catalog
    - Enhanced error handling with fallbacks
    - Progress indicators during query execution"

6. Testing & Validation
   "Stress test the application:
    - Test all 5 explores with various question types
    - Verify inventory queries work (fix 'Missing required field' errors)
    - Test error handling and fallback scenarios
    - Validate query structure generation
    - Check UI responsiveness with different data sizes"

7. Documentation
   "Create comprehensive README covering:
    - Overview and features
    - Quick start guide
    - Architecture diagram
    - Usage guide with examples
    - Configuration details
    - Troubleshooting common issues
    - Deployment instructions"

KEY LEARNINGS
-------------

1. LookML Field Catalog
   - Must include ALL dimensions and measures for each explore
   - Dimensions are required for grouping/filtering
   - Measures are required for metrics
   - Include field descriptions and use cases

2. Gemini Prompt Engineering
   - Provide concrete examples of NL → JSON translation
   - Specify required fields explicitly
   - Add validation rules in prompt
   - Include fallback behavior

3. Streamlit Best Practices
   - Use session_state for persistence
   - Chat message components for conversation UI
   - Transparent backgrounds to avoid display issues
   - Progress bars for long operations

4. Error Handling
   - Validate query structure before execution
   - Provide graceful fallbacks
   - Return mock data when API unavailable
   - Show helpful error messages to users

5. Professional UI
   - Minimal emoji usage
   - Consistent formatting
   - Smart visualizations based on data characteristics
   - Performance metrics visible to users
