# Phase 5: Conversational Analytics Interface

## Problem Statement

Business users need to analyze Adventure Works data but lack SQL/technical skills. Traditional BI tools require understanding table structures, joins, and query syntax. **Goal:** Enable anyone to ask questions in plain English and get instant insights with visualizations.

---

## Deliverable

A web-based conversational analytics interface where users can:
- Ask questions in natural language (e.g., "What were total sales for road bikes last year?")
- Receive automatic visualizations and insights
- Maintain conversation history across multiple chat threads
- Export analysis reports

**Technical Requirements:**
- Integrate Gemini AI for natural language understanding
- Use Looker API to query BigQuery via LookML semantic layer
- Build interactive UI with Streamlit
- Support all 5 data explores (sales, reviews, inventory, purchasing, manufacturing)

---

## Solution

### Architecture

```
User Question (Natural Language)
    ↓
Gemini 2.0 Flash (NL → Looker Query)
    ↓
Looker API (Query → BigQuery)
    ↓
Pandas (Data Processing)
    ↓
Plotly (Visualizations)
    ↓
Streamlit (Web Interface)
```

### Key Components

**1. Gemini Client (`gemini_client.py`)**
- Translates natural language to Looker query structure
- Contains complete LookML field catalog for all 5 explores
- Validates query structure (ensures dimensions + measures)
- Generates AI insights for results (optional)

**2. Looker Client (`looker_client.py`)**
- Executes queries via Looker API
- Handles authentication and connection
- Parses JSON results to Python objects
- Provides mock data fallback for demos

**3. Streamlit App (`app.py`)**
- Interactive chat interface
- Multi-conversation management
- Smart visualizations (auto-selects chart type)
- Performance tracking and analytics
- Professional export reports

### Features Implemented

**Natural Language Querying**
- Ask questions in plain English
- Automatic explore selection based on question topic
- Support for filters, time periods, rankings, groupings

**Smart Visualizations**
- Bar charts for categorical comparisons (≤10 items)
- Line charts for trends and time series (>10 items)
- Statistical summaries (min, max, average)
- Metric cards with intelligent formatting (K/M suffixes)
- Interactive Plotly charts (hover, zoom, pan)

**Conversation Management**
- Multiple independent chat threads
- Switch between conversations
- Per-conversation statistics (query count, avg response time)
- Delete unwanted conversations

**Enterprise Features**
- Settings toggle (AI insights, query details)
- Professional markdown exports
- In-app help system
- Progress indicators
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Response time tracking

**Data Coverage**
- Sales Analysis (orders, revenue, customers, products)
- Product Reviews (ratings, feedback, sentiment)
- Inventory Analysis (stock levels, locations)
- Purchasing Analysis (vendors, procurement)
- Manufacturing Analysis (work orders, scrap rates)

### Technical Highlights

**LookML Integration**
- Complete field catalog for all 5 explores
- Dimensions for grouping (product, customer, date, location, etc.)
- Measures for metrics (totals, counts, averages, rates)
- Proper field naming and descriptions

**AI Prompt Engineering**
- Structured LookML context with examples
- Explicit validation rules
- Concrete NL → JSON query examples
- Fallback behavior defined

**Error Handling**
- Query structure validation
- Mock data when Looker unavailable
- Helpful error messages
- Automatic retry logic

**UI/UX**
- Clean, professional interface
- Transparent chat backgrounds
- Minimal emoji usage
- Responsive design
- Keyboard shortcuts

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add credentials:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
LOOKERSDK_BASE_URL=https://your-looker-instance.cloud.looker.com:19999
LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_ID=your_id
LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
```

**Get API Keys:**
- Gemini: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
- Looker: Admin → Users → Edit → API3 Keys

### 3. Launch Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Opens at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage Examples

### Sales Questions
```
"What were total sales for road bikes in 2014?"
"Show me top 10 customers by revenue"
"Compare sales across territories"
```

### Inventory Questions
```
"Show me current inventory levels"
"Which products are out of stock?"
"Show inventory by location"
```

### Reviews Questions
```
"What's the average rating for helmets?"
"Which products have the most reviews?"
```

### Purchasing Questions
```
"Which vendors have the highest order volumes?"
"Show total purchases by vendor for 2014"
```

### Manufacturing Questions
```
"What's our scrap rate by product?"
"Show work orders by location"
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini AI authentication |
| `LOOKERSDK_BASE_URL` | Looker instance URL |
| `LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_ID` | Looker API client ID |
| `LOOKERSDK_CLIENT_SECRET` | Looker API secret |
| `LOOKERSDK_VERIFY_SSL` | SSL verification (default: true) |

### LookML Field Catalog

Located in `gemini_client.py` (lines 20-97), contains:
- All 5 explores with complete field listings
- Dimensions and measures for each
- Field descriptions and use cases
- Example query structures

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Error initializing clients"
- Check `.env` file exists and has all 5 variables
- Verify API keys are valid
- Check no extra spaces in `.env` values

### "Missing required field: dimensions"
- Fixed in current version with complete field catalog
- Fallback returns valid default query
- Check terminal logs for details

### Questions return mock data
- Looker API may be unavailable
- Check terminal for "Looker API Error" messages
- Verify Looker credentials and network access

### Slow response times
- Normal: 2-3 seconds (AI + Looker + BigQuery)
- Check BigQuery query performance in Looker
- Consider query optimization in LookML

---

## Known Limitations

**By Design:**
- Charts limited to top 10-20 rows for readability
- Statistics for first 2 numeric columns only
- Metrics for first 4 columns only
- Simple chart selection heuristic (≤10 = bar, >10 = line)

**Future Enhancements:**
- Query result caching for repeated questions
- More chart types (pie, scatter, heatmap)
- Custom chart selection by user
- Advanced filtering in data tables
- Query history search

---

## Deployment

### Local Development
Standard workflow (already covered in Quick Start)

### Streamlit Cloud
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud: https://share.streamlit.io
3. Add secrets in dashboard (all environment variables)
4. Deploy

### Production Considerations
- User authentication
- Rate limiting
- Query caching (Redis)
- Monitoring and logging
- Load balancing for concurrent users
